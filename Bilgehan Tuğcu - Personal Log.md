22nd may: spent over 4 hours trying to recursively create buttons and position them correctly
23rd may: didn't do project too much, did discrete math homework. Decided to give up on recursive button creation as it would take too long.
24th may: started implementing a NavController  + fragments thingamabob so that each button leads to a different fragment. there are 6.
25th may: continued implementation of said fragmented view, adding buttons and text fields for user input. Only doing 1 out of the 6 for now, 
if it works it should be easy to copy over to the other 5.
26th may: went to hometown to vote. 8 hour bus ride, couldnt get anything done.
